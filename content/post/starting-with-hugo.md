I'm finally ditching [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and testing out new waters with [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org), the speedy programming language developed by Google.

During this new chapter of my career as a web developer, I'll be moving away from dynamically generated site builders and constructing my new portfolio from the ground up in order to practice and refine my skills with **JavaScript**, **Go**, and **CSS**.

<pre><code class="javascript">var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
</code></pre>

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
