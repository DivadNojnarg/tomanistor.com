I'm finally ditching [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and testing out new waters with [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org). Go is a speedy programming language developed by Google.

During this new chapter of my career as a web developer, I'll be moving away from dynamically generated site builders and constructing my new portfolio from the ground up in order to practice and refine my web developing skills with **JavaScript**, **Go**, and **SCSS**.

## Objectives
- Create portfolio to display work
- Create blog to jot down my progress and help others along the way
- Implement design with SCSS
- Design new Hugo theme and distribute for others to used

When this post is published, the four primary objectives of my new Hugo portfolio site should be complete.

<pre><code class="javascript">var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
</code></pre>

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
